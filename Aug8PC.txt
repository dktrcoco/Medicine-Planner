Pseudocode

We are currently able to properly iterate over the data for side effects.

We need to capture that data somehow (in an array?) and then display in html.

We need to link the submit button so the drug typed into the input is inserted into the url to pull the appropriate data.

We need to make some improvments for styling to make it look more polished

We have a functional date via maria and moment.js.

*We need to attach a counter to subtract one pill every 24 hours in order to create a low pill.

*We make the assumption that there is 1 pill per day, so the countdown is effectively doing down by one count per day.

*We can display all of the inputted medications

*we can make each med a button which will then display the appropriate warning/usage/side effects (like in the weather hw)

*we need to make a clear button for when user runs out of an inputted med
