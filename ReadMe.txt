User Story: As a consumer of medication(s) (prescription or vitamin/supplementals), 
I want a mobile UI-compatible website that is capable of tracking the various medications I take, 
provides reminders (daily & weekly) when to take the medications so I can adhere to a schedule, 
alerts me if there are any adverse combinations of the prescriptions, 
and even keeps track of when Iâ€™m due for a refill of a particular medication.

GIVEN an app that tracks medication use
WHEN I add a medication
THEN the displayed calendar is populated with the times to take the medication, an aside listing side effects is displayed
WHEN I add an additional medication
THEN the displayed calendar is populated with the times to take the medication, 
WHEN (IF) there are adverse interactions with already added medication(s)
THEN an alert will pop up as a warning about taking both medications at once
WHEN I (the user) have taken my medication for the day
THEN the tracker will update that it has been taken and updates the amount of pills remaining
WHEN a user first enters the app
THEN a disclaimer displays indicating the use of this app should be used as a tracker only, not as specific medical advice, please consult your physician for best practice medication

Optional:
WHEN a medication is close to being empty
THEN an alert will pop up indicating a refill will be necessary soon
WHEN a medication is added
THEN the chemical structure of the active ingredient is displayed with the information (Chris having to nerd out)

I want it to have a day-by-day calendar down to the time I should optimally take each medicine/vitamin with a built-in alert system to take the medication.
